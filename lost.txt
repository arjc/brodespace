    <h1>Sorry lil bro! Your device is too smol.</h1>
    <p>
      You are trying to view Brodespace on a small screen. This might cause
      some performance issues and cause the website to be extremely laggy.
      I'll be making a responsive website design for smaller devices soon.
      You can always use a computer or turn on Desktop site view to access
      Brodespace.
